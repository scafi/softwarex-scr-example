# Self-Organising Coordination Regions (SCR) Example

This simulation contains the example of the Self-Organising Coordination Regions described in the software-x paper.

Particularly, in this repository we simulate a scenario in which 
we are interested in temperature monitoring 
and control in a large environment.

To run the simulation, you can type:
```
sbt run
```

This produces the following result:
